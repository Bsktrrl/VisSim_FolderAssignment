## Project Description
This was my Folder Exam in the course "Visualization and Simulation".
<br>
<br>
Here, I have visualized points from a pointcloud, mapping an area from eastern Norway (where I grew up).
<br>
<br>
I have used regular triangulation to make a grid from the pointcloud, making it organized and less costly to build a mesh out of.
The grid has been saved to file for easier access.

In addition, I have simulated physiscs on the terrain using barysentric coordinates so that droplets could fall from the sky hitting the terrain, and increase the water level on it.
